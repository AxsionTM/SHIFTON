# Hi!
This is my first website that I built myself, and I'm learning to be a programmer.

Launch instructions:

Download the file, open it, and run index.html. It will take you to the page itself. Alternatively, run it in your editor, run it in Go Live, and point it to this address: http://127.0.0.1:5500/

Also, if you are interested in the Figma layout, here it is -> https://www.figma.com/design/Yz8dmOdjuZ5JEpa3O9asTk/shifton.com--Copy-?node-id=311-403&t=JyEjeuiXfAN0QTIB-0

Thanks a lot ðŸ˜€ðŸ‘‹
